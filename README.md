# EFacies: Multiscale electrofacies analysis on borhole data

A workflow for stochastic electrofacies classification from borehold depth data.

# How does it work?

The procedure used:
1. Preprocessing including normalization
2. Principle component analysis to decorrelate the data
3. Self organizing maps for initial classification
4. Hierarchical clustering to obtain the multiscale classification

# How to run?

Check the main.m file for an example on how to use the code.
